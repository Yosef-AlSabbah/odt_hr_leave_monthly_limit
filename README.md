# HR Leave Monthly Limit – Workshop Project

This repository contains a workshop project developed within the **OdooTec technical team**.
The activity divided participants into two groups:

* **Development Team:** responsible for implementing the module logic.
* **Unit Testing Team:** responsible for writing tests to challenge the implementation.

## Project Goal

The objective is to implement a robust Odoo module that **prevents employees from taking more than 5 leave days per month**.

The challenge is to ensure the implementation is solid enough to withstand strict unit testing — if the tests fail, the testing team wins.

## Development Team

* Ahmed Tohamy
* Yousef Al Sabbah (Me)
* Mahmoud
* Sara
* Mohammed Ragab
